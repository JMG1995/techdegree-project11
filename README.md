# React Flickr Gallery
## Joseph Grant - Techdegree Project 11
This project was an introduction to using React in a real world application. It uses the 'axios' API to fetch data from the Flickr site and display it on the screen.

## Setting up:
To view this application, download the files from [Github](https://github.com/JMG1995/techdegree-project11), create a file named 'Config.js' in the src directory and set it up as follows:
  
    
    const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
    export default apiKey;
    
*You can get your API Key from [the Flickr website](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html).*
Then, using your command line, navigate to the directory and run `npm start`.
If you find any issues, please feel free to let me know.

Regards,

Joseph
